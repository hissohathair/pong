# pong
 
The original code is from [Project 0](https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/2018/projects/0/) 
from HarvardX's [CS50 Introduction to Game Development](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50G+Games/home)

The purpose of this assignment was to implement a computer controlled player.

For my own amusement, my player occassionally "cheats" and can play itself.
